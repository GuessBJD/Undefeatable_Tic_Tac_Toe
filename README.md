# Undefeatable_Tic_Tac_Toe

## About
Coursework group research project of Principle of Artificial Intelligence. A console application tic tac toe game for studying the rationality of AI in playing sequential games. The featured AI bot in the game was achieved with the use of Minimax Algorithm to calculate the best move that prioritise on selecting actions that minimize the maximum loss. The application was coded in C++.

## Details
### Research content
- Reviewed Game Theory
- Studied the relationship between Game Theory and the sense of rationality in playing Combinatorial Games
- Reviewed the Principle of Minimax Theorem
- Studied how Minimax algorithm implements Minimax Theorem insights in selecting rational actions
- Developed a rational agent/bot using Minimax algorithm to play tic tac toe
- Experimented the rationality of the rational agent in playing tic tac toe

### Research outcome
- A rational agent always maximize the minimum loss or namely minimize the maximum loss
  - Maximize the minimum loss: To prioritize options with minimum loss *-one to secure a decision that maximizes his utility knowing the apponent will do everything they can to minimize his utility-*
  - Minimize the maximum loss: To avoid options with maximum loss *-one to secure a decision that minimizes the payoff of the opponent's knowing the opponent to do everything they can to maximize their payoff-*
- Proved the rationality of the rational agent in playing tic tac toe through given that the rational agent never loses the game
  - If the agent is rational, it will never lose the game. If the agent loses the game, it does not possess rationality. Such that:
    - The agent always wins the game when there is an opprtunity
    - The agent always at least ensure a draw
